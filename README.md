  ## Synopsis

Code fellows 201 first week lab assignment. In this assignment each day we built pieces of an About Me page. We learned about prompts and alerts to ask questions, which lead the the creation of the the guessing game. By the end of the week we had created a series of questions and simplified our code using new knowledge found with functions.

## Code Example

There are no examples or uses for this code just purely a training exercise.

## Motivation

This is my first real project that combines HTML CSS and JS all on a webpage that got published through github.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
